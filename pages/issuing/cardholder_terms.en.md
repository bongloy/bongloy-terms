## IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW CARD ACCOUNT

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Cambodian law, requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a Card Account. What this means for you: When you open a Card Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see a copy of your national ID or passport, or other identifying documents.

You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services everywhere UnionPay cards or BONGLOY cards are accepted as long as you do not exceed the value available on your Card Account.

For security reasons, we may limit the amount or number of transactions you can make on your Card. Your Card cannot be redeemed for cash. You may not use your Card for online gambling or any illegal transaction.

Each time you use your Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in your Card Account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You are not allowed to exceed the available amount in your Card Account through an individual transaction or a series of transactions.

Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the balance of the funds available on your Card, you shall remain fully liable to us for the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees.

You do not have the right to stop payment on any purchase or payment transaction originated by use of your Card. If you authorize a transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of funds for up to thirty (30) days. 

### Returns and Refunds

If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, you agree to accept credits to your Card for such refunds and agree to the refund policy of that merchant. The Issuer is not responsible for the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspects of goods or services that you purchase from others with a Card. All such disputes must be addressed and handled directly with the merchant from whom those goods or services were provided.

### Card Replacement

If you need to replace your Card for any reason, please return to a branch of the financial institution where the Card was purchased to obtain an immediate replacement, or launch your mobile app., or contact us at +855(0)23 532 0888 to request a replacement Card be mailed to you. You will be required to provide personal information which may include your Card number, full name, transaction history, etc. There is a fee for replacing your Card. 

### Card Transfers

You may transfer funds to another card on the program.

### Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies

If you obtain your funds or make a purchase in a currency other than the currency in which your Card was issued, the amount deducted from your funds will be converted by BONGLOY into an amount in the currency of your Card. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by BONGLOY from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate BONGLOY itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. 

### Receipts

You should get a receipt at the time you make a transaction using your Card. You agree to retain, verify, and reconcile your transactions and receipts.

### Card Account Balance/Periodic Statements

You are responsible for keeping track of your Card Account available balance. Merchants generally will not be able to determine your available balance. It’s important to know your available balance before making any transaction. You may obtain information about the amount of money you have remaining in your Card Account by viewing the available balance in the app. 

### Fee Schedule

All fee amounts will be withdrawn from your Card Account and will be assessed as long as there is a remaining balance on your Card Account, except where prohibited by law. Anytime your remaining Card Account balance is less than the fee amount being assessed, the balance of your Card Account will be applied to the fee amount resulting in a zero balance on your Card Account.

The fee schedule can be found at your mobile app.

There is a fee for this service. Please refer to the fee schedule above. The Issuer reserves the right to refuse to return any unused balance amount less than US$1.00.

### Information About Your Right to Dispute Transactions

In case of a discrepancy or questions about your electronic transactions, call +855(0)23 532 0888 .  You must contact us no later than thirty (30) calendar days after we posted the transaction(s) to the Card Account. 

You agree to cooperate fully with our investigation and to provide any additional information or documentation we may need for the claim.

Once we have the required details, information, and/or documents, we will determine whether a discrepancy occurred. If we ask you to put details in writing and you do not provide them within thirty (30) calendar days of the date we posted the transaction(s) you are questioning, we may not be able to resolve the claim in your favor.

In some circumstances, card scheme rules allow us to charge a transaction on the account back to the merchant with whom you made the transaction. This is known as a chargeback. If it is available, we will claim a charge right for a transaction on your account if you ask us to do so in written; the transaction is higher than US$30.00; and you give us the information and material we require to support a chargeback, within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the statement on which the transaction is recorded. The ability to dispute a transaction may be lost if it is not reported to us within these timeframes.

We will tell you the results in writing after completing our investigation. If we determine a discrepancy occurred we will correct the discrepancy promptly and credit the Card Account. If we decide there was no discrepancy, we will send you a written explanation.

You acknowledge and agree that the existence of a dispute or chargeback shall not relieve your obligation to pay dispute handling charge or applicable fee and you agree to pay promptly such charges, notwithstanding any dispute or chargeback whatsoever.
